# FRIEND
It is a C++ based CLI program made for learning C and this comes along with some games



"FRIEND" ( CLI VERSION )

INTRODUCTION: The main idea behind the project is to give user a program that helps students in learning C.

It has text contents from "LET US C BY YASHWANT KANETKAR" free to use version 


VERSION 1.0000: The First release version of this project would be a CLI (VERSION 1.0000).

"IN THIS REPOSITORY WE WOULD BE WORKING ON VERSION 1.0000"

The current version would be having only limited contents of "LET US C"


The algorithm for the project is:

The MVP has:

If else based menu program.
In one of the Option it has "Reading content"
In the other option it has "Games"


In further minor updates we'll have multiple games, test series and better and more readable content.
The Major update would be a GUI.
